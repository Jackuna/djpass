# djpass : django-password-generator

A simple password generator django app clubbed with Bootstrap 4, this project is just a django implemanation of one of my python script within my repository PythonXample  [PythonXample/PyPassGen.py](https://github.com/Jackuna/PythonXample/blob/master/PyPassGen.py). 

This project has been designed to meet the daily system admin requirement to generate strong and random passwords.


It has cool features like

* Cool and resposive UI

* Supports exclusions within random passwords too.

* Supports Multidigit password generation.

* Refresh dialog to regenerate same desired password length.

* More features yet to be added.
